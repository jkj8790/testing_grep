Doohan calls for upgrade to 1000cc bikes 
</HEADLINE>

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Four-time world 500cc motorcycling
champion Mick Doohan has called for the establishment of a new
1000cc class, featuring four-stroke engines, to replace the
existing machines.
	   Doohan, who was second behind Spanish teammate Alex Criville in
Sunday's 500cc French Grand Prix, believes a move to 1000cc
four-stroke machines would attract new manufacturers such as BMW,
Ferrari and Ford to grand prix racing as engine builders and
suppliers.
	   The 500cc class is the top division for motorcycle racing, but
Doohan said the two-stroke V4 machines raced by Japanese
manufacturers Honda, Yamaha and Suzuki for the past 15 years faced
a limited future.
	   ``It seems to me the two strokes are reaching the end of their
era because the 500 V4s have been doing the same lap times for the
past five years,'' Doohan said Monday.
	   ``We're not making leaps and bounds forward anymore, the bikes
never really change, and people lose interest. There's been talk
about switching to four-stroke grand prix bikes and I think it
would be awesome to go to a 1000cc prototype.''
	   Doohan said changing up to 1000cc bikes with light, small
engines would make the sport more interesting, and more fun for the
riders.
	   ``Going to four-stroke prototypes would take the sport to the
	next level and open up racing to other manufacturers like BMW, or
even Ford and Ferrari to build engines,'' Doohan said. ``Yamaha
made Formula One engines even though they don't build cars so it
could work the other way around.''
	   Doohan, who has won 48 grand prix races from 126 starts in the
500cc class since 1989, said a move to 1000cc four-stroke machines
would be expensive, but the benefits would justify the costs.
	   ``Racing four-strokes would cost more, but the manufacturers
aren't afraid to spend if it will do them good,'' Doohan said.
``It's no use trying to keep it cheap because this isn't club
racing. If some people can't afford to run four-stroke grand prix
bikes there's plenty of other championships for them to race in.''
